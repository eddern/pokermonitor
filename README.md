### User stories 

As a user, I want to see a timer count down to zero before it resets because I want an overview of when the blinds change

As a user, I want to be able to configure the duration that is counted down from, so I can alter the blinds increase interval

As a user, I want to be able to configure the blind increase so that you can alter the amount that is increased

As a user, I want to be able to automatically suggest what the blind increase should be based on buy-in.
